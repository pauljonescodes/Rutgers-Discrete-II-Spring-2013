\noindent\textbf{Instructions:} Point values for each problem are listed.
Write your solutions neatly or type them up.  Typed solutions will also be
accepted via Sakai.

\begin{enumerate}


\item (5 points) Let $X$ be a random variable on some sample space $S$ with
expected value $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.  Let $X_1$ and
$X_2$ be \emph{identical independent copies} of $X$.  Find
$E((X_1 - X_2)^2)$ in terms of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$.  Give some intuition for why your answer makes sense.

\item (3 points) Prove that $V(cX) = c^2 V(X)$ for any random variable $X$ and
real number $c$.

\item (5 points) Let $X$ be the random variable that is the sum of two
independent fair die rolls.  Let $Y$ be the outcome of the first roll minus the
outcome of the second roll.  Calculate $\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)$.
Are $X$ and $Y$ correlated?

\item (4 points) Let $C$ be the random variable that is the number of heads in
$100$ independent fair coin flips.  What are $E(C)$ and $V(C)$?  Find upper
bounds on $P(C > 75)$, using Markov's Inequality and Tchebychev's Inequality.

\item (4 points) Find an example where Markov's inequality is tight in the
follow sense: For each  positive integer $a$, find a non-negative random
variable $X$ such that $P(X\geq a) = E(X)/a$.

\item (4 points) Prove the following: If $X$ is a non-negative random variable
with $E(X) = \mu$, then for every $k$, $P(X \geq k\mu) \leq 1/k$.
\textsf{Hint:  Apply Markov's inequality.}

\item \textbf{Extra credit (4 points):} If $X$ is a non-negative
random variable with $E(X) = \mu$, then Markov's inequality tells us
that for every $a$, $P(X \geq a) \leq \mu/a$.  As we saw in class,
this bound is sometimes very loose.  In this problem we'll look at
a situation in which extra information can be used to tighten the
bound.

Suppose that we are told $X$ is \emph{bounded
from below by some number $b$}, meaning $P(X \geq b) = 1$.  Use this information
to find a tighter bound on $P(X \geq a)$.  \textsf{Hint:  Apply Markov's
inequality to the r.v.  $Y = X - b$.}

For concreteness, suppose $E(X) = 1000$ and $P(X \geq 500) = 1$.  Markov's
says that $P(X \geq 2000) \leq 1000/2000 = 1/2$.  Use your method find a
tighter bound on $P(X \geq 2000)$.
